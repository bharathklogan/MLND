# Data Pipeline Case-Study

### Software Requirements

This project was built and tested on Debain Jesse with Python 2.7.13

### fileformat_conversion.py

This is a python module which will be used as a tool to convert csv file into different format such as xml, html, json, yaml
We can extend this module to add any new functionality as this was implemented using Object Oriented Programming.

### test_fileconvert.py

This is a standalone script used that I developed to test this tool.

### Execution Instructions
Modify the object initialization in the file test_fileconvert.py to include the input csv file and output file name without 
any extension, then execute the script by simply issuing the following command:

python test_fileconvert.py
